# govDados Project

The Govdados project is an independent association composed of leaders from both the public and private sectors working with DATA PROTECTION. <br>

{% include elements/figure.html image="/assets/images/govdados-c.jpeg" caption="govDados logo" %}

Its main objective is to promote a culture of privacy and personal data protection, as well as to encourage initiatives related to artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data governance. 

The initiative aims to develop guidelines and policies that ensure the ethical and responsible use of data, promoting security and trust in emerging technologies.

## What i did

I worked as a volunteer and developed the following deliverables:

 - Infrastructure (server, email, database)
 - Main website
 - Administrative site (back office)


## Ruby on Rails


The reason for choosing Ruby and Rails was to learn how a language and framework based on the Low-Code concept can facilitate the development of any system, at any scale.

In this project, I chose the Ruby programming language, the Rails framework, MariaDB as the relational database, and a few other tools such as Bootstrap and jQuery to develop a responsive website and a simplified CMS.

Few days from scratch to production!!

## Privacy and Security by Design

I developed a data architecture so that the publicly-facing website was isolated from any administrative tools, creating a secure system with no possibility of data leaks or exposure of private data.

With the developed architecture, even in the event of a security breach affecting the entire server, no data beyond what is designated for public access is leaked.
