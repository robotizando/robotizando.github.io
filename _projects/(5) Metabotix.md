# Metabotix


Metabotix is the name of the **Robotics and Open Technologies Laboratory at IFG Campus Luziânia**. <br>

The laboratory develops and applies open technologies for education and relies on the collaboration of multipliers of this proposal, who carry out actions to disseminate new technologies throughout the national territory. <br>

Metabotix also operates in a social context, participating in various collaborative initiatives that apply open technologies to help society.

Finally, the laboratory has an affirmative program for women, aiming to promote the technology field and inspire high school girls (in its various modalities) to gain a better understanding of the area and feel motivated to pursue a career.
