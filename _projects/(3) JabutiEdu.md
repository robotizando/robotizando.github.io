# Jabuti Edu

{% include elements/figure.html image="/assets/images/jabutiedu-robo.jpg" %}

The Jabuti Edu platform is a project of Free Educational Robotics developed by the Jabuti Edu Community. 

Built on the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, the Jabuti Edu Project aims to develop a simple, affordable, and useful platform for teaching robotics to children and teenagers.

It is developed using open technologies, and all its code is licensed under the AGPL, while its hardware is licensed under the CERN Open Hardware License V1.2L. Incorporating a full computer, a pair of motors, LEDs, and an embedded Linux system, Jabuti opens up numerous possibilities for educators and their students.

# What we do together

I participated as an active volunteer member and developed the following deliverables:

- Hardware
	- Version of a simple robot for competitions
	- Competition track with time marking
	- Several objects for 3D printing

- Software
	- Class management system
	- Classroom server module with a control panel for the teacher and participation of 20 connected students with their robots (PHP, Javascript, MySQL, HTML5, CSS)
	- Integration module between robots and the class management system (C++)
