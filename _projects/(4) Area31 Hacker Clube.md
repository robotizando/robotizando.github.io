# Area 31 Hacker Space

Área31 is a Hackerspace founded on 29/04/2013 in Belo Horizonte-MG. It serves as a private organization facilitating knowledge exchange through its own infrastructure, enabling technology enthusiasts to pursue projects in diverse fields such as cybernetics, interplanetary networks, telecommunications, electronics, software, robotics, security, biohacking, and quantum computing — or anything else creativity allows. <br>


It can also be seen as a social club or a secular fraternal organization, created and maintained by its founding members. New members are admitted upon recommendation by an existing member. 

Área31 conducts secretive research, with only select projects made public for obvious reasons. It exclusively accepts "DNA hackers," as it's deemed impossible to train an ordinary human to become a hacker. 

The Hackerspace frowns upon any entity that falsely claims to "create hackers" through courses, training, or mere attendance at events or other Hackerspaces.
